Features of the Calculator

Two Calculation Modes:
Find the Hypotenuse: Input two legs (a and b), and it calculates the hypotenuse using the formula c = √(a² + b²).
Find a Missing Leg: Input one leg (a or b) and the hypotenuse (c), and it calculates the missing leg using the formula a = √(c² - b²).

Validation:
Prevents negative inputs.
Ensures that the hypotenuse is always larger than the known leg.
Displays clear error messages for invalid inputs.

Results:
Displays results below the corresponding calculate button for clarity.
Formats the result to two decimal places.
